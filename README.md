## Description

 This NodeJS project generates a table of employees saved into mySql based on users input from the command prompt. I built this project to get familiar with mySql, the MySQL2 npm package and the console.table package. This project also reviews how to use promises, inquirer, how to work with recursive functions, and how to loop through user data. I can now use this tool as part of my portfolio of javascript projects.
